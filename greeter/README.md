> You'll notice that there are two different contracts in this code: *"Mortal"* and *"Greeter"*.
>
> This is because Solidity (the high level contract language we are using) has inheritance, meaning that one contract can inherit characteristics of another.
>
> This is very useful to simplify coding as common traits of contracts don't need to be rewritten every time, and all contracts can be written in smaller, more readable chunks.
